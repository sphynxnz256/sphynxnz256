# Hi I'm Aaron
### Software Developer

I have a Bachelors Degree of Applied IT where I learned to develop software using java, python and c#. I worked for a company for 6months where I wrote a script to intercept data from a weighbridge indicator using micro-python. I helped write a python script to build a real time monitor for a weighbridge. I helped build a full LAMP stack website to manage a weighbride using python, php, mysql, html, css, javascript and laraval. I have also been teaching myself languages like c and c++ where I built a little clicker game and am now working on teaching myself react.js and other web development skills.
